# Trang (Jamie) Nguyen - Data Enthusiast

## About Me  
Hi, this is Trang (Jamie) Nguyen, a data enthusiast who loves diving into data and unearthing hidden insights â€” much like a gold digger, but not *that* kind of gold digger ~~  
When I'm not wrangling data, you can find me experimenting with new Machine Learning algorithms or pretending to be a wise old man, sipping a cup of tea while reading about the hypothesis of a planet inhabited by life forms based on metal instead of organic matter.
